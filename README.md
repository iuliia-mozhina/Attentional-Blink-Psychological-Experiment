# Attentional-Blink-Psychological-Experiment
Final project in the scope of the course "Programming experiments in psychology" at the University of Potsdam (summer semester 2023).

The attentional blink paradigm has been used to study the time course of attention. Classic studies by Raymond, Shapiro & Arnell (1992) and Chun & Potter (1995) show that access to short term memory is temporarily blocked as long as a stimulus is processed. Such a temporary deficit of attention has imnplications for everyday situations, e.g., when driving.

In the prototypical attentional blink paradigm, two targets are presented in an RSVP stream. The measure is the detection (or categorization) performance for a second target as a function of how shortly it follows a first target. Current research addresses the question of which cognitive processes modulate the attentinal blink. In the present experiment we investigate whether executive control processes used in the resolution of Stroop interference extend the attentional blink.
